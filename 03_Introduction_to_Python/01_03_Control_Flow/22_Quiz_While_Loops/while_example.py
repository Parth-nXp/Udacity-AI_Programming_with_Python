'''
Suppose you want to count from some number start_num by another number count_by until you hit a final number end_num. 
Use break_num as the variable that you'll change each time through the loop. 
For simplicity, assume that end_num is always larger than start_num and count_by is always positive.

Before the loop, what do you want to set break_num equal to? 
How do you want to change break_num each time through the loop? 
What condition will you use to see when it's time to stop looping?

After the loop is done, print out break_num, showing the value that indicated it was time to stop looping. 
It is the case that break_num should be a number that is the first number larger than end_num.
'''

start_num = 1#provide some start number
end_num = 30#provide some end number that you stop when you hit
count_by = 4#provide some number to count by 

# write a while loop that uses break_num as the ongoing number to 
break_num = start_num
while break_num <= end_num:
    break_num += count_by
#   check against end_num


print(break_num)
