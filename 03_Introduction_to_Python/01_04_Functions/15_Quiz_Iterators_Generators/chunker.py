'''
If you have an iterable that is too large to fit in memory in full (e.g., when dealing with large files), being able to take and use chunks of it at a time can be very valuable.

Implement a generator function, chunker, that takes in an iterable and yields a chunk of a specified size at a time.

Calling the function like this:

for chunk in chunker(range(25), 4):
    print(list(chunk))
should output:

[0, 1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6, 7]
[8, 9, 10, 11]
[12, 13, 14, 15]
[16, 17, 18, 19]
[20, 21, 22, 23]
[24]
'''

def chunker(iterable, size):
    count = 0

    for i in range(0,len(iterable),size):
        yield iterable[i:i + size]



for chunk in chunker(range(25), 4):
    print(list(chunk))
